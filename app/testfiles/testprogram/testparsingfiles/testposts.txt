Hello Everyone,

I've asked the LCS/Echo360 Gods to permit our unit's recordings to be available from 
outside Blackboard, and accessible from our webpage's left-hand margin without requiring 
you to login to Blackboard (as it's been in previous years).

Until then, you can access last Tuesday's lecture via Blackboard (ho hum!).

Chris.

You may now access our LCS recordings directly, from the left margin of our unit's webpage, without 
needing to go through LMS.  Thanks to those that reported the problem.
